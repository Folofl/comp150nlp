===============================================================================

For part 3, I added a new <propernouns> tag/section at the top of the xml file.
The tag contains all names, locations and other proper nouns found in the text.

I tried to avoid incorrectly tagging capitalized words that are not proper 
nouns (first word of a sentence, etc) and cleaned up the resulting list by
removing months, days of the week and pronouns (boring cases).

Some uninteresting words still slipped through ('New', maybe from New England
and 'Sat' from typo of 'sat', etc), but I got a pretty good list of characters
and locations anyway. If I was getting ready for some sort of an in-class
discussion about the book in an English class I would probably look up the
character list online, and with this processing step it is not necessary.

Apparently the name 'Michael Scott' appears in the text. Unsurprisingly, it
was not THE Michael Scott, but it was a fun discovery.


I was trying to figure out a clever use of stemming/lemmatization, but could
not come up with a useful application. Maybe I spent too much doing stupidly
complicated regex matching, but it seems like the Text Analysis Online samples
didn't really provide a new way to look up words of interest. Also, the 
lemmatizer didn't make as many synonym replacements as I expected (like the
car -> automobile example from class), so I don't know what to do with it.

The POS Tagging seemed more interesting as a way to look for fancy adjectives
but the amount of results was so overwhelming that it didn't seem useful.
